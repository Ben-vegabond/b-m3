# Project b-m3

Hello! This is my first attempt on creating a password generator. This allows you to create a password with common requirements use on everyday sites.

## 🧠 User Story 

**GIVEN** I need a new, secure password
**WHEN** I click the button to generate a password
**THEN** I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
**WHEN** prompted for password criteria
**THEN** I select which criteria to include in the password
**WHEN** prompted for the length of the password
**THEN** I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
**WHEN** asked for character types to include in the password
**THEN** I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
**WHEN** I answer each prompt
**THEN** my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
**WHEN** all prompts are answered
**THEN** a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
**WHEN** the password is generated
**THEN** the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page


## 🌐 How to Operate 

Navigation is simple, Here is how to get started:

1. click on the generate button
2. type in a passsword that you would like to try
3. click submit 
4. you will be followed by some alerts if the password doesnt meet the requirements 
5. repeat until user is satisfied 

## 🔮 Future Development

As a new developer, I want to keep growing and learning.
I would like to remove the alreats and put all the information on the actual HTML and incorporate it with more CSS.
